# Key Decisions

* [DEPRECATED] Using Google Gemini AI (Gemini 2.0 Flash, model ID: gemini-2.0-flash-001) to process git commits into summaries and time estimates, with the API key stored in `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
* Using Google Gemini AI (Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite Preview 06-17, model ID: gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-06-17) to process git commits into summaries and time estimates, with the API key stored in `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
* [DEPRECATED] Updated time estimate scaling to divide LLM time estimates by 2 instead of 4 to reduce estimate reduction intensity.
* Removed time estimate scaling/division; use LLM-provided estimates directly (rounded to the nearest half hour) and cap at 4 hours per project per day to simplify estimation and avoid overly low durations.

# Recent Work

* Removed division logic for time estimates and implemented a maximum cap of 4 hours per project per day.
* Updated README to reflect the new 4-hour daily cap instead of 6 hours.
* Updated time estimate scaling logic: changed division factor from 4 to 2 to reduce estimate reduction intensity.
* Updated the Gemini model from `gemini-2.0-flash-001` to `gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-06-17` for commit summarization and time estimation (configuration change).
