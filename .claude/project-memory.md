# Key Decisions

* [DEPRECATED] Using Google Gemini AI (Gemini 2.0 Flash, model ID: gemini-2.0-flash-001) to process git commits into summaries and time estimates, with the API key stored in `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
* Using Google Gemini AI (Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite Preview 06-17, model ID: gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-06-17) to process git commits into summaries and time estimates, with the API key stored in `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

# Recent Work

* Updated the Gemini model from `gemini-2.0-flash-001` to `gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-06-17` for commit summarization and time estimation (configuration change)
