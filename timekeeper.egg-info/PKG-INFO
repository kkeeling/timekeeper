# Timekeep

Automated time tracking for development projects using git commit analysis and Claude Code SDK.

## Overview

Timekeep is a workflow agent that:
- Fetches active projects from your Notion workspace
- Analyzes git logs to identify work done each day
- Estimates development time based on commit complexity
- Generates time tracking summaries

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Node.js (for Claude Code CLI)
- Claude Code CLI installed globally
- Access to Notion API via MCP configuration

## Setup

1. **Install Claude Code CLI** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment** (optional):
   - Edit `.env` file if you need custom configuration
   - Currently uses Claude Code's default authentication

## Usage

Run the script manually:
```bash
python timekeeper.py
```

Expected output:
```
Timekeep - Running at 2025-01-01 10:00:00

## Current Features

✅ Connects to Claude Code SDK
✅ Fetches active projects from Notion
✅ Displays project list with IDs

## Planned Features

- [ ] Git log analysis for each project
- [ ] Time estimation based on commit complexity
- [ ] Summary report generation
- [ ] Automatic nightly execution at 10pm
- [ ] TimeCamp integration for time tracking

## Project Structure

└── README.md         # This file
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors:

1. **"Claude Code CLI not found"**: Ensure Claude Code is installed globally
2. **"No projects found"**: Check that your Notion integration has access to the Projects database
3. **Authentication errors**: Make sure Claude Code CLI is properly authenticated

## Development

This project uses a simple architecture:
- Python for the main logic
- Claude Code SDK for AI-powered analysis
- Notion API (via MCP) for project management
- Git commands for repository analysis (coming soon)
